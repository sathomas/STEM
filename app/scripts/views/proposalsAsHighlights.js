                // as a row of 4. When creating the view, we're passing
                // in an explicit parent element instead of letting
                // the model view create it's own parent (which is the
                // default). We do that for a couple of reasons.
                //
                // First, we want to make sure that the element has
                // the appropriate Bootstrap class for rendering four
                // in a row. There's no need for the proposal view
                // to know how many are in a row, so we handle it
                // here.
                //
                // Second, there's a chance that, in the future, our
                // proposal models may be dynamic. If that's the case,
                // we want to defer completely to the models' views
                // to deal with any changes. If we let the model
                // view create the parent element, then any updates
                // would overwrite our changes, in particular, they
                // would remove the Bootstrap class that we need to
                // add.
