        This site is constructed as a single page web application, which means
        that all the content for all of the sites "pages" is in this single
        HTML file. What appear to the user as "pages" are simply `<section>`
        elements in this file. A single `<header>` and `<footer>` surround all
        of the sections.

        There's a conflict in the security settings for the APIs on which
        the site relies that prevents it from working in IE9 and earler.
        (The OAE only supports https: access while DonorsChoose and other
        APIs only support http: access; IE9 doesn't really allow mixing
        the two in a user-friendly way.)

        Header (including Navigation Bar)
        =================================

        The site `<header>` includes a branding element and main navigation.
        The branding element is clickable (to return to the "landing page"),
        and the navigation supports each of the three major user personas.
        Initially, the navigation links are hashtags to `id`s within the
        landing page panels. This linkage allows the site to function
        (a) if JavaScript fails or has been disabled by the user, and (b)
        on devices whose screen width is too small to implement the
        full tab panel.

        The theme for the header is set using a `data-` attribrute instead
        of a class because we expect JavaScript to manipulate it when
        switching pages.

        -->

        <header role="banner" class="site-hdr" data-theme="theme-1-dark">

            <!--

            For now, the "brand" is really just a placeholder, just
            generic text with a border. The styles for the brand (in
            `header.less`) are tied pretty specifically to the content
            here. They should probably be revised together.

                To control the collapse/expand state of the navigation
                bar in a smaller viewport, we use a hidden checkbox.
                This approach is pure CSS, so we don't need any
                JavaScript code to deal with the navbar. (There is,
                however, a small JavaScript enhancement that improves
                the experience just a bit. It's not required, though.)

        Main Page Content
        =================

        The main page content follows the header. As noted above, that content
        is a series of `<section>` elements, where each section acts (to the
        user) as a distinct web page.

                We provide a heading for the section to orient users relying
                on screen readers, since, for them, it won't be obvious that
                the site is organized as sections representing separate pages.
                To visual users, however, the organization should be apparent,
                so the heading is only required for screen readers.

                This pattern repeats for all sections and articles in the page,
                although some headings are not always hidden from visual users.

                <!--

                The landing page (when displayed on a desktop viewport) has
                an internal navigation block to control the display of a
                selected discovery block. That navigation block is functionally
                a set of radio boxes that operate as tabs. (The discovery
                blocks themselves are the tab panels.) Although it would be
                possible to control the panel visibility with just CSS, doing
                so would require some serious contortions to the markup
                structure. If JavaScript isn't available, we're better off
                simply making all the tab panels visible (they'll stack
                vertically) anyway. As a result, we can keep the markup sane
                and separate the tabs from the tab panels.

                The `data-discovery-nav` attribute identifies the panel
                that's currently visible. Screen readers just get all the
                content in linear form, so there is no need to use ARIA
                roles for a full-on tab/tab panel interface.

                        The movement to advance STEM education in Georgia is
                        gaining momentum, but it can still be difficult to

                        education through reflective practice, professional
                        learning, and collaboration.
